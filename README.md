Milestone Project 1
This is the first of five project that will result in a diploma software development. For now this is the title as the project is still to be determend.
To prepare for this project I have come up with three ideas that I think could have real world applicability. 
1. My own CV-page, where I could introduce myself to potential employers or customers.
2. A page for the surgical association at my local university. Problem here is that almost all the main information would be in swedish, but a translation is a valid option as the university has an international reach, although not for there medical programme. A back-up idea would be for their medical biology programme which is an internationl programme completely given in english.
3. Is a guide for people who have no idea where and how to start coding, but are curious about it. Maybe they think it's to hard for them to ever do it.

Background:
For the meta-tags I have evaluated different search terms on GoogleTrends, to find the most search for terminology and semantic composition. This will of course be improved over the duartion of the project.

Demographic evaluation- as my time is short, I will use a couple of hours for demographic research to find out what people need from a website, what are they looking for.
For project idea:
1. I will call a couple of recruiters and ask what they would like to see from webbased CV, I will also google what recruiters look for in a developer.
2. I will talk to students what they would like from an accosiaton page. If picked I will talk to the student counceler for an activity schedule if one is available.
3. In this project I could include myself, as I am one of these people. I never thought I would be able to do any development. But I'm also going to try doing a small survey on facebook amongst friends.
